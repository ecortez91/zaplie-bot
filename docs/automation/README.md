# Automated rewards: GitHub pull requests

Zaplie pays a reward when a pull request is merged in a connected repository.
GitHub calls the bot directly through a signed webhook. The bot checks the
signature, works out the amount from the admin's settings, checks the period
budget, and pays from a dedicated treasury wallet.

Nothing pays until an admin has set an amount and a budget. Every amount, level
bonus, per-person base and budget is a setting; there are no built-in amounts.

```
GitHub (repository webhook, "Pull requests")
   │  X-Hub-Signature-256 = HMAC-SHA256(raw body, GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
   ▼
Zaplie bot  POST /api/v1/github/webhook
   │ 503 if GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET is unset; 401 on a missing or wrong signature
   │ only pull_request / closed / merged: true earns a reward (others: 204)
   │ idempotency key = the signed pull request id (one reward per PR)
   │ repository must be connected under Automations → Connections (else 403)
   │ GitHub numeric id → verified identity → LNbits user (unlinked: pending)
   │ amount = person's base override, else the org base, + highest level bonus
   │ amount ≤ REWARDS_MAX_AMOUNT_SATS, and fits the period budget (else 402)

pays from the "Automation" treasury wallet → recipient's Private wallet
```

## 1. Configure the bot

Set these on the bot App Service, alongside the existing LNbits settings. Names
only here; values live in App Service settings and nowhere else.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Shared secret GitHub signs each delivery with. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` and paste the same value into every repository webhook. Unset: the webhook answers 503 and pays nothing. |
| `REWARDS_TREASURY_ADMINKEY` | Admin key of the treasury wallet that pays rewards (see below). |
| `WEBSITE_API_URL` | Base URL of the portal backend API, including `/api` (for example `https://<portal-domain>/api`). The bot reads amounts, policy and identities from it. |
| `TAB_BACKEND_TOKEN` | Shared secret the bot sends to the portal backend. Must be a real value, the same on both apps, or every reward fails before payment. |
| `REWARDS_MAX_AMOUNT_SATS` | Ceiling for one reward (base plus bonus). Defaults to 10000. Set it on the bot and the portal backend. A malformed value fails closed. |
| `REWARDS_BUDGET_PERIOD`, `REWARDS_BUDGET_CAP_SATS`, `REWARDS_BUDGET_TIMEZONE` | Optional. Each one that is set overrides the portal's budget field of the same name (`week` or `month`; a positive whole number of sats; an IANA zone such as `Europe/London`). |
| `REWARDS_API_KEY` | Optional. Only for other callers of `POST /api/v1/rewards` (section 5); GitHub does not use it. |

### Treasury wallet

Rewards are paid from a dedicated treasury, never from a teammate's Allowance:

1. In LNbits, create a user named `automation` (lower case) with one wallet.
   Do not name it `Allowance`. The portal finds the treasury by that username;
   set `TREASURY_USERNAME` on the portal backend if you use another name.
2. Fund it with **one budget period at most**. The bot's budget ledger is the
   first limit; the wallet balance is the second, independent one.
3. Set `REWARDS_TREASURY_ADMINKEY` to that wallet's **Admin key**.

Payments carry the memo `GitHub: PR #<n> merged - <title>` and show as sent by
"Automation" in the recipient's transaction log.

## 2. Configure the portal

In the portal, open **Automations**. Only a `Zaplie.Admin` can edit; everyone
else sees the values read-only.

1. **Connections**: add each repository (`owner/repo`) that should earn
   rewards. A delivery from any other repository is refused with 403.
2. **Reward rules**: set the amount for "pull request merged". Until it is set
   the card reads "Not set: pays nothing" and the bot answers 503.
3. **Reward policy → Budget**: weekly or monthly, the cap in sats, and the
   time zone the period follows. Until a budget is set (here or in the
   `REWARDS_BUDGET_*` settings) every reward answers 503.
4. **Reward policy → Level bonuses** (optional): a label prefix (for example
   `reward:`) and levels with a bonus each (for example `L1`, `L2`, `L3`).
5. **Reward policy → Per-person base** (optional): a different base amount
   for a named person.

Every value is checked in the browser and again by the server: positive whole
sats only, and the largest base plus the largest bonus must stay within
`REWARDS_MAX_AMOUNT_SATS`.

Each teammate links GitHub once under **Settings → Connect GitHub**. A reward
for someone who has not linked yet is held as pending in the portal and is not
paid automatically; an operator pays it by hand.

## 3. Add the webhook to each repository

In the repository: **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**

- **Payload URL**: `https://<bot-domain>/api/v1/github/webhook`
- **Content type**: `application/json` (form-encoded deliveries are refused
  with 415)
- **Secret**: the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` value
- **Events**: "Let me select individual events" → **Pull requests** only

GitHub sends a `ping` first; the bot answers 204. Try it on a test repository
with a small amount before connecting the real ones.

If the repository still has a webhook to the legacy Logic App, **remove it in
the same change**. Both paths send the same idempotency key
(`github:pull_request:<id>:merged`), so a merge one path has paid replays on
the other and is never paid twice; but the Logic App's trigger verifies
nothing, so it must not stay in front of a funded treasury.

## 4. How the amount is decided

For a merged pull request by a linked teammate:

1. **Base**: that person's per-person base for the event if one is set,
   otherwise the org amount from Reward rules. Neither set: 503, nothing paid.
2. **Bonus**: the labels on the pull request when it merged are compared with
   `<prefix><level>` for each configured level (case-insensitive, as GitHub
   compares labels). The highest matching bonus is added. Bonuses are never
   summed, and labels that match no level are ignored.
3. **Cap**: base plus bonus must be at most `REWARDS_MAX_AMOUNT_SATS`, or
   nothing is paid.
4. **Budget**: the amount is reserved in the current period (ISO week, Monday
   to Sunday, or calendar month, in the configured time zone). The period is
   taken when the bot processes the delivery, not from the merge time, so a
   late or redelivered merge counts in the period it arrives in. If it would
   take the period over the cap the answer is 402 and nothing is paid.

An unlinked author gets the org base plus the bonus, held as pending. Pending
rewards count against the budget.

Labels must be on the pull request **before** it merges. A label added later
changes nothing: the reward for that pull request has already been decided,
and a redelivery replays it. Anyone with triage rights can add a label; that
is accepted for staff use and should be revisited before customers use it.

### Responses

| Situation | Response | Paid? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` unset | 503 | No |
| Signature missing, malformed or wrong | 401 | No |
| Not a JSON content type | 415 | No |
| Body over 1 MB | 413 | No |
| `ping`, any other event, or a PR closed without merging | 204 | No |
| Merge more than 30 days old (replay protection) | 422 | No |
| Repository not connected | 403 | No |
| No amount or no budget configured | 503 | No |
| Over the period budget | 402 | No |
| Paid | 200 `{"status":"paid",...}` | Yes |
| Author has not linked GitHub | 202 `{"status":"pending",...}` | Held |
| The same pull request again (GitHub redelivery, or a resent capture) | The first answer, with `Idempotency-Replayed: true` | No |
| Payment outcome unknown | 500, then 409 `uncertain` on every repeat | Maybe: reconcile |

A 402 releases the reward's key. Redelivering it from GitHub (**Settings →
Webhooks → Recent deliveries → Redeliver**) in a later period pays it; that is
a person's decision, never automatic.

### Idempotency

The webhook's idempotency key is the pull request's own id, from the signed
body (`github:pull_request:<id>:merged`). It is deliberately not
`X-GitHub-Delivery`: that header is not covered by the signature, so a
captured request resent under a new delivery id must still replay rather than
pay. The legacy Logic App template sends the same key, so the two paths share
one ledger entry per merge. A merge older than 30 days is refused so a replay
can never outlive the reward ledger's 90-day record.

The bot records each key in `bot-reward-ledger.json`, and each budget
reservation in `bot-reward-budget.json`, both under `ZAPLIE_DATA_DIR` (see
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.adoc`). A reward whose payment outcome is unknown stays
`uncertain` and blocks every repeat until an operator reconciles it; it is
never cleared or retried automatically.

## 5. The rewards API (other callers)

`POST /api/v1/rewards` runs the same pipeline for callers that are not GitHub,
such as a smoke test. It takes `X-Api-Key` (`REWARDS_API_KEY` or a key created
under **Automations → Reward API keys**) and a caller-chosen `Idempotency-Key`
(1 to 256 printable ASCII characters, unique per reward):

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://<bot-domain>/api/v1/rewards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $REWARDS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -d '{"recipient":"octocat","recipientId":"583231","eventType":"githubPrMerged","repo":"octo-org/octo-repo","reason":"GitHub: PR #1 merged","source":"github","labels":["reward:L1"]}'
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `recipient` | Display label (the GitHub login). |
| `recipientId` | GitHub's stable numeric user id; the identity graph is keyed on it. |
| `eventType` | `githubPrMerged`, `githubIssueClosed` or `githubReviewSubmitted`. |
| `repo` | `owner/repo`, exactly as connected under Automations. |
| `reason` | Invoice memo. |
| `source` | `github`. |
| `labels` | Optional: up to 50 printable ASCII strings of 1 to 50 characters. |

`amountSats` is refused: the amount always comes from the settings. Each new
`Idempotency-Key` is a new reward and counts against the budget. Sending the
same key twice replays the first answer with `Idempotency-Replayed: true`.

## Legacy: the Logic App template

`github-rewards-logicapp.json` is the earlier pilot: a Logic App Request
trigger that forwarded GitHub events to `POST /api/v1/rewards`. Its trigger
does not verify GitHub's signature, so its `source: "github"` is a claim, not
proof. It is kept for reference only. **Do not deploy it in front of a funded
treasury**; use the signed webhook above.

## Power Pulse is a pending product decision

The data model records reward events and sats paid. It does not record
authoritative time, money or CO2 savings, so the Automations page must not
infer or display those measurements yet. Before adding Power Pulse, define the
source, unit, ownership, storage and idempotency rules for each measurement and
persist them alongside the automation event.
